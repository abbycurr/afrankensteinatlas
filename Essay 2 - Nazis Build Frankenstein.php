    <h2> Nazis Build Frankenstein </h2>
    <p> During World War II, all sides were focused on the best way to quickly win the war in their favor. This involved a lot of experimentation with various technologies. One area that the Nazis exolored was the development of the superhuman through different drugs. Victor Frankenstein was likewise focused on creating a new, superior race that would improve upon the current model. This essay will explore the human fascination with creating a super race and the different motivations behind doing so with a specific focus on the scientific movements of the late 1700's/early 1800's and the early 1900's. Arguably, the end goal did not change in over a hundred years, but the methods and motivations changed, which wil be the subject of this essay. </p>
